Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Couplefy app (hereafter referred to as the "Application"), developed by Fearplay (hereafter referred to as the "Service Provider") as a free mobile application. The Application is provided "as is" and is intended for use by all age groups — including children. There are no age restrictions, as the app does not contain content or features unsuitable for younger users.

Data Collection and Use

The Application does not collect any personal or technical information, such as IP address, location, usage duration, or device type.

No data is ever transmitted off the user's device, and the Application does not use any third-party services that would collect, track, or analyze user data.
All information remains strictly local to the device and is used solely to ensure proper functioning and personalization within the app.

Locally Stored Data

The Application stores some user-provided data locally on the device. This includes:

• Names entered by the user (e.g., couple names)
• Relationship start date
• Visual preferences (e.g., dark mode, language settings)
• An image selected by the user to visually represent their relationship within the app

This data is never transmitted, never shared, and never accessible to the Service Provider or any other party.
If a user wishes to remove this data, they can do so simply by uninstalling the app.

Security

The Application does not use network connections, does not transmit data, and does not collect any user information. All data remains fully under the user's control on their own device.

Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be published on this page. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy periodically.

Effective Date:
May 28, 2025

Your Consent

By using the Application, you acknowledge and agree that all data remains on your device and that no personal information is processed or transmitted externally.

Contact

If you have any questions regarding privacy or the Application itself, you can reach the Service Provider at: sausfearplay@gmail.com
