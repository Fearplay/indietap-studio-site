What the Game Is

• We do not collect or store your personal data on our servers.

Limitation of Liability

Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless IndieTapStudio and affiliates from claims and expenses arising from your breach of these Terms, unlawful use, or violation of third-party rights.

Changes, Suspension, Termination

• We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time.
• We may suspend/terminate access for violations, legal, security, or operational reasons.
• You may stop using the App anytime by uninstalling it; uninstalling permanently deletes local game data.

Consumer Rights (EEA/UK)

You are not in a comprehensively sanctioned country and are not a prohibited party; you will comply with applicable export/sanctions laws.

Severability & Waiver

• If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, the rest remain in effect.
• Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.

Updates to These Terms

We may revise these Terms; the updated version will carry an updated Effective Date.
Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.
