Privacy Policy

Controller: FairplayX (Juraj Acsay)

INTRODUCTION

FairplayX ("we") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled in the Clickoji mobile application ("App"). The App is free and ad-supported. We do not run our own backend, do not require registration, and do not send marketing emails. We do not collect or store your personal data on our servers. Any advertising-related data, where applicable, is processed by Google AdMob under its own policies.

Audience: We design Clickoji for users 13+. Users under 16 will not see any ads. Users 16+ may see ads (personalized only with consent).

DATA WE COLLECT

A) Data stored locally on your device
• Age category only (over/under 16) – stored as a boolean for ad restrictions.
• Game progress and settings – e.g., scores, achievements, sound/music, theme, language.

These data remain only on your device in local Hive storage. We do not receive or access them.

B) Data collected by third parties (Google AdMob) — shown only to users 16+
To display ads, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect and process:
• Advertising ID (GAID/IDFA) and basic device info
• Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)
• Approximate location (country/region inferred from IP/network; no precise GPS)
• Diagnostics/performance data (app reliability, fraud prevention)

Ads are provided by Google AdMob (Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; for users in the EEA/UK: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, D04 E5W5, Ireland). Google acts as an independent controller for the purposes of ad delivery and measurement. Processing is governed by Google's policies: https://policies.google.com/privacy and https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

For users under 16, we do not show ads and therefore do not initialize AdMob ad requests for that user group.

PURPOSES & LEGAL BASES (GDPR/UK GDPR)

• Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)) for personalized ads and measurement via Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) where available.
• Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)) for security, diagnostics, and fraud prevention (limited to what is necessary).
• Age gating: We store only a boolean (> / < 16) to apply ad restrictions and compliance rules.

Where consent is refused (or not available), ads—if any—are non-personalized and/or disabled according to your age category (under 16 = no ads).

YOUR CHOICES

• Manage consent & ad personalization in Settings → Privacy Options (opens UMP).
• Reset/limit Advertising ID in your device settings.
• California residents: use "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" in Privacy Options.

CHILDREN & TEENS

The App is not directed to children under 13 (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect children's personal information. We store only an age category (boolean). Under 16: no ads. If you believe a child under 13 used the App and provided information, contact us and we will delete any such information that we can access.

DATA RETENTION

• Local game data: kept only on your device until you uninstall the App. Uninstalling permanently deletes these data.
• AdMob data: retained by Google according to its policies. We do not retain advertising data on our servers.

SHARING & TRANSFERS

We do not sell your personal information. Limited identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID) may be shared with Google AdMob to serve and measure ads (only for users 16+). Ads are served by Google AdMob (Google LLC / Google Ireland Limited – see above); Google acts as an independent controller and may process personal data in the United States and other countries in line with its policies and applicable data transfer safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses).

SECURITY

All ad/network traffic uses HTTPS/TLS. Local game data remain on your device. We take steps to protect information, but no method is 100% secure.

YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS

EEA/UK (GDPR/UK GDPR)
You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object (including to processing based on legitimate interests), and data portability, and to withdraw consent at any time (does not affect prior lawful processing). You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. In the Czech Republic: Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů (ÚOOÚ).

To exercise rights, email **indietapstudio@gmail.com**.

California (CCPA/CPRA)
We do not sell personal information. We may share Advertising ID with Google AdMob for cross-context behavioral advertising (for users 16+). Opt-out: available via Privacy Options in the App or device settings. Your rights: know/access, delete, correct, limit use of sensitive PI (not collected), opt-out of sale/share, and non-discrimination. Requests: email **indietapstudio@gmail.com** (we respond within 45 days).

Categories collected in the last 12 months (for users 16+ seeing ads):
• Identifiers (Advertising ID)
• App activity (ad impressions, clicks)
• Approximate geolocation (country/region inferred by Google)
• Diagnostics (performance/fraud-prevention signals)

CALOPPA

This policy shows an effective date. It is linked from the App (Settings → About App → Privacy Policy) and from the Google Play listing. Do Not Track (DNT): we do not respond to DNT signals (no industry standard). Control ads via device settings and Privacy Options.

INTERNATIONAL USERS

Your data (if processed by Google AdMob) may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your place of residence. Ads are served by Google AdMob (Google LLC / Google Ireland Limited – see above). Google acts as an independent controller and may process personal data in the United States and other countries in accordance with its policies and applicable data transfer safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses).

CHANGES

We may update this Privacy Policy. The latest version will always be posted with an updated effective date.
