Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless FairplayX and affiliates from claims and expenses arising from your breach of these Terms, unlawful use, or violation of third-party rights.

Changes, Suspension, Termination

• We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time.
• We may suspend/terminate access for violations, legal, security, or operational reasons.

• Disputes will be resolved by the competent courts in the Czech Republic.

Consumer Rights (EEA/UK)

Nothing here limits your non-waivable consumer rights under mandatory EEA/UK law; those rights prevail in case of conflict.

Export & Sanctions Compliance

You are not in a comprehensively sanctioned country and are not a prohibited party; you will comply with applicable export/sanctions laws.

Severability & Waiver

• If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, the rest remain in effect.
• Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.

Updates to These Terms

We may revise these Terms; the updated version will carry an updated Effective Date.
Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.
